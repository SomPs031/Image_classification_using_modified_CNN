# Image_classification_using_modified_CNN
A modified CNN model for image classification that analyzes and compares each layer’s output to find the best performer. It retrains using early-layer features for improved accuracy with less data. Includes Grad-CAM for explainability and threshold tuning for precision—enhancing efficiency, transparency, and debugging.
