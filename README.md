🧠 Intelligent Image Classification using Modified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
An innovative approach to image classification that not only leverages the power of CNNs but also introduces layer-wise performance analysis and adaptive retraining. This project redefines how we interpret and improve deep learning models by using partial feature representations for training and prediction.

🚀 Project Overview
This CNN-based model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and re-engineered to evaluate the feature extraction ability of individual layers. By comparing intermediate layer outputs and retraining the model based on early-layer predictions, we demonstrate how less information can still result in accurate classification.

🔁 This method helps:

Identify the most efficient layer for prediction.

Improve model performance with less computational depth.

Enhance debugging and interpretability of CNNs.

Reduce human effort in fine-tuning deep learning pipelines.

🔍 Key Innovations
🧩 Partial Layer-Based Prediction: Uses the output of initial CNN layers for classification, proving that meaningful predictions can be made with minimal data.

🧪 Layer-Wise Comparison: Analyzes and compares accuracy at each layer to identify the optimal feature extractor.

🎯 Retraining Strategy: Refines the model by training on early-layer predictions to boost final classification accuracy.

🧠 Explainability with Grad-CAM: Visualizes which image regions influenced predictions.

⚖️ Threshold Tuning: Optimizes precision-recall balance by adjusting decision thresholds dynamically.
